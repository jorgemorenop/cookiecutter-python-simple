# Cookiecutter: Simple python project

Cookiecutter template for a simple Python project that includes some pre-configured static analysis tools and tests. 

You can create a new project based on this template using `cookiecutter`:

1. Install *cookiecutter* with `pip`:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install cookiecutter
   ```
2. Supposing that you have git configured, run:
   ```bash
   cookiecutter gh:jorgemorenop/cookiecutter-python-simple
   ```

This will create a new project using the contents of the {{cookiecutter.__project_slug}} folder. Check the Readme.md file
within that folder for more information about it.
